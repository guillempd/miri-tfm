## Project Description
This is the accompanying implementation for my Master's thesis, for more details check the [report](https://github.com/guillempd/miri-tfm/blob/master/report.pdf).

## Building the project
The project is provided as a CMake project with all the dependencies included, so it should be straightforward to compile for those familiar with CMake.
If any problem arises during this process please don't hesitate to contact me.

## Running the project
When running the program make sure that the current working directory of the executable contains the resources directory as the source code expects.
